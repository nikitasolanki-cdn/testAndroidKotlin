Android Kotlin Developer Case Study

Brancehs Created:
1. master
2. developement
3. users_list_workspace
4. detail_screen

Used component:
• MVVM
• Dagger 2
• Data Binding and Binding adapters
• Github
• Retrofit
• Glide
• Gson
• SHaredPreferences

We have developed sample application using Android-Kotlin with component above,
we used two different activity for the different screen.
Application development used latest MVVM jetpack component for data modeling and populating on UI.





-Problem ---------------------------------------------------------------
A demo application should be developed using the two separate APIs shared below, which can be used
without authorize with the Github Rest API. The application must be developed with Kotlin.
APIs:
https://api.github.com/users
https://api.github.com/users/{login}
The following technologies and version control systems are expected to be used while the project is
being developed.
• MVVM
• Dagger 2
• Data Binding
• Github or Bitbucket
General summary of the application:
When the app is first opened, Git users are listed with their profile photos and username information.
There is a search bar at the top of the page.
If a particular user is wanted to be searched, the first the user in the search is listed instead of the
loaded data.
Clicking on one of the listed users is directed to the detail page.
On the detail page All available data provided by the API is displayed on the screen.
When the application is re-entered, the user whose last detail was looked at is marked as different from
the others if it is in the list (it can be shown in a different color).
Important points:
Registering the previously detailed user with SharedPreference and from there reading is expected.
In addition; Dependency of the SharedPreference class where it will be used
It is expected to be injected with Injection.
In addition, for each developed feature, working with separate branches and pushing to Github or
Bitbucket needs to be done. Commits should be descriptive and clear.
*The design of the project can be changed according to your decision.
